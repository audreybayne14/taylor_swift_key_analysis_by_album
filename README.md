# "Swifting" Through the Data: An Album-by-Album Key Signature Analysis

**Objective**

The goal of this project is to analyze the key signatures of Taylor Swift's songs across her albums to understand the musical evolution and complexity of her work. By visualizing the data in radar charts, the project provides insights into the distribution and variety of key signatures used in her music.

**Data Collection**

The data for this project was scraped from Spotify's public API, focusing on the key signatures of songs from Taylor Swift's albums. The dataset includes the counts of songs in each key for each album in order of release.

**Visualization & Analysis**

After the key signature data was categorized by album, the data was visualized into radar charts, representing twelve major and twelve minor key signatures. An analysis of the radar charts reveals the following information about Swift's albums:

- **Debut:** Simple major keys, characteristic of country music.
- **Fearless:** Similar range to Debut, commonly in F and D.
- **Speak Now:** Introduction of minor keys, adding complexity.
- **Red:** Mix of major and minor keys, indicating a broader range.
- **1989:** More dispersion in key signatures with a transition into pop.
- **Reputation:** Most cohesive album, mostly using C and Am, reflecting a unified sound.
- **Lover:** Varied keys with an exuberant feel, including sharper, complex keys.
- **Folklore:** Flat keys with a contemplative feel, leaning towards complexity.
- **Evermore:** Returns to the key of C, but with some songs in sharper keys.
- **Midnights:** Broad variety of major keys with minor key elements.
